# Sleep

This was my solution to an examn with very strict rules. I got a list of css-properties and html-tags that was allowed, and was not allowed to use javascript. The problem specification was simply "Make a website about sleep".

Css is actually turing complete with input elements (you can use checkboxes to store bits), but unfortunately input elements were disallowed. This led me to come up with all kinds of workarounds- my favorite was using transitions and variables to count in binary.

It's an interesting read. I got a D I think- apparently my teacher did not fancy css binary clocks.

[Open website](https://blackcapcoder.github.io/sleep/). You might want to edit the settings at the top of `main.css` as the site is fairly processor intensive.
