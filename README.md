# Sleep

[Open website](https://blackcapcoder.github.io/sleep/)

This was my solution to an examn with very strict rules. I got a list of css-properties and html-tags that was allowed, and was not allowed to use javascript. The problem specification was simply "Make a website about sleep".

Css is actually turing complete with input elements (you can use checkboxes to store bits), but unfortunately input elements were disallowed. This led me to come up with all kinds of workarounds- my favorite was using animations and variables to count in binary. It's an interesting read.

I got the grade D I think; apparently my teacher do not like css binary clocks.
